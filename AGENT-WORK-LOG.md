## Usage Instructions

### For Agents:
1. **ALWAYS** document your work using the template above
2. **BE SPECIFIC** - Claude Code needs to understand exactly what you did
3. **INCLUDE FILES** - List every file you created or modified
4. **VALIDATE WORK** - Test your changes and document results
5. **PREPARE HANDOFF** - Explain what's ready for the next phase

### For Claude Code:
1. **READ THIS FILE** immediately after any agent work
2. **VALIDATE** the agent's work by running tests/builds
3. **ACKNOWLEDGE** understanding of what was accomplished
4. **PLAN NEXT STEPS** based on agent documentation

This protocol ensures continuity and prevents context loss during agent handoffs.
