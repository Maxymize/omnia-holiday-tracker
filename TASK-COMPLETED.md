  <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  
  // After: Responsive layout with text truncation
  <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:items-center sm:justify-between space-y-4 sm:space-y-0">
    <div className="flex-1 min-w-0">
      <h1 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold truncate">
  ```

    </div>

    // Original layout preserved
  </div>
  ```
- **Result**: ✅ Mobile users can scroll horizontally through tabs with full readability

### Critical Bug Fixes ✅

#### Infinite Loop in Holiday Request Conflict Checking
- **Issue**: "Verifica conflitti..." message appeared infinitely during holiday request creation
- **Root Cause**: Circular dependencies in `useEffect` calling `checkForConflicts`
- **File Modified**: `components/forms/multi-step-holiday-request.tsx`
- **Technical Fix**:
  ```typescript
  // Before: Circular dependency causing infinite loop
  }, [startDate, endDate, checkForConflicts])

  }, [startDate, endDate])
  
  // Added protection against multiple simultaneous checks
  if (isCheckingConflicts) {
    console.log('Conflict check already in progress, skipping...')
    return
  }
  ```

- **Files Modified**:
  - `components/forms/multi-step-holiday-request.tsx` (Frontend fix)
  - `netlify/functions/create-holiday-request.ts` (Backend fix)
- **Frontend Solution**:
  ```typescript
  // Before: Always sent null causing validation error
  medicalCertificateFileName: selectedFile?.name || null
  
  // After: Conditionally include field only if file exists
  ...(selectedFile?.name && { medicalCertificateFileName: selectedFile.name })
  ```
- **Backend Schema Fix**:
  ```typescript
  // Before: Schema rejected null values
  medicalCertificateFileName: z.string().optional()
  
  // After: Schema accepts null values
  medicalCertificateFileName: z.string().optional().nullable()
  ```
- **Validation Logic Update**: Simplified to only check `medicalCertificateOption` presence
- **Impact**: ✅ Sick leave requests with "send later" option now work correctly

**Completed**: 2025-08-23 | **Session**: Claude Code Direct
**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Context**: Fixed critical synchronization bug in "Apply to All" functionality

#### Bug Description:
The "Apply to All" button had a synchronization issue where:
- User sets vacation days to 30 in the admin interface
- Button applies 27 days (old database value) instead of 30 (interface value)
- Caused confusion and incorrect vacation day assignments

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- Function name error in `components/admin/system-settings.tsx:410`
- Code called `handleSaveIndividual()` (non-existent function)
- Should have called `handleSaveSetting()` (correct function name)
- This prevented saving the interface value before applying to all users

#### Solution Implemented:
- ✅ **Fixed Function Call**: Changed `handleSaveIndividual` → `handleSaveSetting`
- ✅ **Database Sync Logic**: "Apply to All" now saves setting first, then applies to employees
- ✅ **Verified Fix**: User confirmed 30-day setting now correctly applies 30 days to employees
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Employee dashboards immediately reflect changes

#### Technical Details:
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
await handleSaveIndividual('system.default_holiday_allowance');

// After (FIXED):
await handleSaveSetting('system.default_holiday_allowance');
```

#### Impact:
- **Complete Vacation Management System**: Individual editing + bulk apply both working perfectly
- **Admin Workflow Restored**: Admins can now confidently apply vacation day changes
- **Data Integrity**: Interface values now match applied database values
- **User Experience**: Seamless workflow with immediate visual feedback

### Real-time Vacation Days Display Fix ✅
**Completed**: 2025-08-23 | **Session**: Claude Code Direct
**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Context**: Fixed all vacation day displays to update instantly without page refresh

#### Problem Description:
After fixing the "Apply to All" synchronization bug, the vacation days header updated correctly, but other display elements throughout the dashboard still showed outdated values from cached `stats` instead of the real-time `user.holidayAllowance`.

#### User Feedback Analysis:
> "ok, si aggiorna ora immediatamente i giorni nella barra colorata in cima alla pagina, ma non si aggornano i valori in 'giorni disponibili' e in 'saldo ferie' all'interno della pagina"

The user correctly identified that while the header worked, other UI elements were inconsistent.

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- **HolidayBalance Component**: Used `stats.remainingDays` and `stats.totalAllowance` from cached calculations
- **Dashboard Cards**: Multiple locations used `stats.remainingDays` instead of real-time calculations
- **Profile Section**: Both annual and remaining days used outdated `stats` values
- **Sidebar Stats**: Used cached `stats.remainingDays` for display

#### Solution Implemented:
- ✅ **HolidayBalance Component Enhancement**: Added `user` prop and calculated `remainingDays = user.holidayAllowance - stats.usedDays`
- ✅ **Dashboard Cards Update**: All cards now use `user.holidayAllowance` and real-time calculations
- ✅ **Profile Section Fix**: Both "Giorni Ferie Annuali" and "Giorni Rimanenti" use direct user values
- ✅ **Sidebar Stats Fix**: Calculate remaining days using live `user.holidayAllowance - stats.usedDays`
- ✅ **Simplified Refresh Logic**: Removed complex timing and force re-render mechanisms
- ✅ **Component Props**: Pass `user` prop to all HolidayBalance instances

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Before (PROBLEMATIC):
<div>{stats.remainingDays}</div>
<div>{stats.totalAllowance}</div>

// After (FIXED):
<div>{user.holidayAllowance - stats.usedDays}</div>
<div>{user.holidayAllowance}</div>
```

#### Impact:
- **Perfect Real-time Sync**: All vacation day displays update instantly across entire dashboard
- **Zero-delay Updates**: No page refresh or manual refresh button needed
- **Consistent User Experience**: All UI elements show identical values simultaneously
- **Simplified Codebase**: Removed complex timing mechanisms and dependency management
- **Production Ready**: Bulletproof real-time vacation day management system

### Vacation Days Calculation & getUserInitials Fix (v1.9.3) ✅
**Completed**: 2025-08-23 | **Session**: Claude Code Direct  
**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Context**: Fixed vacation days calculation divergence and JavaScript runtime error

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Hardcoded Values in Holiday Forms**: Multi-step holiday request form showed incorrect vacation days calculations
2. **getUserInitials JavaScript Error**: Admin panel crashed when displaying employee avatars with null names

#### User Feedback Analysis:
> "nell'interfaccia dipendente, nuova richiesta ferie, ci sono ancora valori hardcoded... mentre dovrebbero essere entrmbi 0"
> "getUserInitials@... [Error] TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'name.split')"

#### Problems Fixed:
- **HolidayRequestForm & MultiStepHolidayRequest**: Used hardcoded `holidayAllowance = 20` and `usedDays = 5`
- **Holiday Request Page Header**: Statistics cards showed hardcoded values instead of real user data
- **Admin Holiday Requests**: getUserInitials function failed on null/undefined employee names
- **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple "possibly undefined" errors for user.holidayAllowance

#### Solution Implemented:
- ✅ **Real-time Data Integration**: Replaced hardcoded values with useAuth() and useHolidays() hooks
- ✅ **Dynamic Calculations**: `remainingDays = user.holidayAllowance - stats.usedDays`
- ✅ **getUserInitials Fix**: Added null checks and fallback return '??' for undefined names
- ✅ **TypeScript Compliance**: Added proper null checks and optional chaining throughout
- ✅ **ESLint Fix**: Corrected quote escaping in system-settings.tsx
- ✅ **Consistent Data Display**: All components now use real-time user data

#### Files Modified:
- `components/forms/multi-step-holiday-request.tsx` - Real-time data integration
- `components/forms/holiday-request-form.tsx` - Dynamic vacation calculations  
- `app/[locale]/(employee)/holiday-request/page.tsx` - Fixed header statistics
- `components/admin/holiday-requests-management.tsx` - getUserInitials error fix
- `components/dashboard/holiday-balance.tsx` - Interface updates for optional props
- `app/[locale]/(employee)/employee-dashboard/page.tsx` - TypeScript null checks
- `components/admin/system-settings.tsx` - ESLint quote fix

#### Testing & Validation:
- ✅ Holiday request form shows accurate remaining days calculation
- ✅ Admin panel displays employee avatars without JavaScript errors
- ✅ All vacation day displays synchronized across components
- ✅ TypeScript build successful with no errors
- ✅ Server runs without runtime errors

#### Impact:
- **User Experience**: Holiday request form now shows accurate vacation days information
- **System Stability**: Admin panel no longer crashes when viewing employee requests
- **Data Consistency**: All vacation day displays use real-time database values
- **Developer Experience**: Clean TypeScript build with proper null handling

## ✅ Version 1.9.8 - CRITICAL FIXES + PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (August 25, 2025)

### 🐛 Auto-Refresh Infinite Loop Bug Fix
**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Status**: RESOLVED ✅ | **Agent**: manual-debugging
- [x] **Issue**: useHolidays hook causing hundreds of API calls per second due to unstable dependencies
- [x] **Root Cause**: `useCallback` dependencies recreating `debouncedFetchHolidays` continuously
- [x] **Solution**: Stabilized parameters with useRef, reduced dependency array to user.id only
- [x] **Impact**: Eliminated fastidious automatic refreshes, improved performance dramatically

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic)
const debouncedFetchHolidays = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... API logic using viewMode directly
}, [user, viewMode, status, year, limit, offset]); // ❌ Too many changing dependencies

// AFTER (stable)
const paramsRef = useRef({ viewMode, status, year, limit, offset });
const debouncedFetchHolidays = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... API logic using paramsRef.current
}, [user?.id]); // ✅ Only user ID dependency
```

### 🎨 Dashboard Layout Recovery
**Priority**: HIGH | **Status**: RESOLVED ✅ | **Agent**: manual-debugging
- [x] **Issue**: Beautiful dashboard blocks (statistics cards, icons, colors) disappeared after component changes
- [x] **Root Cause**: Experimental RejectedRequests component causing layout conflicts
- [x] **Solution**: Removed problematic component, restored original layout structure
- [x] **Impact**: Restored all visual elements: Saldo Permessi cards, statistics, icons (🏖️ 👤 🏥)

### 💬 Rejection Reason Visibility Enhancement
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Status**: COMPLETED ✅ | **Agent**: manual-implementation  
- [x] **Feature**: Added clear rejection reason display in employee holiday history table
- [x] **Implementation**: Red-highlighted sections showing admin rejection motivations
- [x] **Database**: Updated Holiday interface to include rejectionReason field (already in DB schema)
- [x] **UX**: Both mobile and desktop views with distinct visual styling

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Added to Holiday interface
interface Holiday {
  // ... existing fields
  rejectionReason?: string;
}

// Visual implementation with red highlighting
{holiday.status === 'rejected' && holiday.rejectionReason && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded p-2">
    <span className="text-red-700 font-medium">Motivo del rifiuto:</span>
    <div className="text-red-800">{holiday.rejectionReason}</div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 🔧 Runtime Error Resolution  
**Priority**: HIGH | **Status**: RESOLVED ✅ | **Agent**: manual-debugging
- [x] **Error**: "viewMode is not defined" ReferenceError in useHolidays hook
- [x] **Solution**: Updated all console.log statements to use paramsRef.current.viewMode
- [x] **Testing**: Server restart to clear browser cache and confirm fix

### 🎯 System Stability Achievement
**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Status**: ACHIEVED ✅
- [x] **Performance**: No more automatic refresh interruptions
- [x] **UX**: Manual "Aggiorna" button working correctly
- [x] **Stability**: Clean console logs, no runtime errors
- [x] **Visual**: All dashboard elements preserved and functional

#### Testing & Validation:
