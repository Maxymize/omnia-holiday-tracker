# Omnia Holiday Tracker - Task Management

## ü§ñ AI Tools Usage Guidelines

### **MANDATORY: Use Specialized Agents & MCP Tools**

**CRITICAL**: Claude Code must actively use available agents and MCP servers without waiting for explicit requests.

**Available Agents**:
- **backend-api-specialist**: Netlify Functions, APIs, server logic
- **frontend-react-specialist**: React components, Next.js, UI  
- **database-specialist**: Drizzle ORM, schemas, migrations
- **security-auth-specialist**: JWT, authentication, security
- **seo-engineer**: Performance, accessibility, SEO
- **web-copywriter**: UI text, messages, content

**MCP Servers**:
- **context7**: Research documentation for ANY library/tool
- Check available MCPs with list command

### **üö® CRITICAL: Agent Documentation Protocol**

**PROBLEM**: Claude Code loses context after agent handoffs.

**SOLUTION**: Every agent MUST document their work before returning control.

**Agent Completion Checklist**:
1. ‚úÖ Update TASK.md with completion details
2. ‚úÖ Create/update AGENT-WORK-LOG.md with work summary
3. ‚úÖ Leave STATUS-HANDOFF.md note for Claude Code
4. ‚úÖ List all files created/modified
5. ‚úÖ Document key decisions and next steps

**Claude Code Response Protocol**:
1. üìñ Read agent documentation immediately upon regaining control
2. ‚úÖ Validate agent work (run tests, check builds)
3. üìù Acknowledge understanding of completed work
4. ‚û°Ô∏è Plan next steps based on agent documentation

**Usage Rules**:
1. Research with context7 BEFORE implementing new libraries
2. Delegate complex tasks to appropriate specialists
3. Use agents proactively, not reactively
4. Document agent usage in task completion notes
5. ALWAYS follow handoff documentation protocol

**Issues Resolved**:

**üö® CRITICAL SERVER STABILITY & CALENDAR API ISSUES - DEVELOPMENT PHASE 3.6 (CONTINUED)**

**NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED**: Admin Dashboard Calendar 404 Error

**THE PROBLEM**: After fixing server connectivity, the admin dashboard calendar section was showing HTTP 404 errors when trying to fetch holiday data:
- Error: "Request from ::1: GET /.netlify/functions/holidays/get-holidays?startDate=2025-08-01&endDate=2025-08-31&view=own&limit=100" 
- Calendar section completely non-functional with persistent 404 errors
- User reported: "dici che √® risolto ma non lo √®" (you say it's resolved but it's not)

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: 
While we had updated the main admin data hooks (`useAdminData`) to use mock APIs during Phase 2 server fixes, the calendar components were still making direct API calls to the original database-dependent endpoints. This created an inconsistent system where some parts worked (employee lists, departments, settings) but calendar functionality failed.

**THE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION**:

**Phase 1: Update Main Data Hook**
- Updated `useHolidays.ts` hook to call `get-holidays-mock` instead of `holidays/get-holidays`
- Fixed API parameter naming from `view_mode` to `viewMode` to match mock API
- Updated Holiday interface from snake_case to camelCase to match mock data structure:
  - `start_date` ‚Üí `startDate`
  - `end_date` ‚Üí `endDate` 
  - `working_days` ‚Üí `workingDays`
  - `created_at` ‚Üí `createdAt`

**Phase 2: Fix Direct API Calls Bypassing Hook System**
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Found 4 additional files making direct API calls that bypassed the hook system
- Updated all remaining files with direct calendar API calls:
  1. `components/calendar/integrated-calendar.tsx` - Desktop calendar component
  2. `components/calendar/mobile-calendar.tsx` - Mobile calendar component  
  3. `components/forms/multi-step-holiday-request.tsx` - Holiday request conflict checking
  4. `app/[locale]/(employee)/holiday-request/page.tsx` - Employee holiday request page

**Phase 3: Data Structure Consistency**
- Fixed all field references in hooks and helper functions to use camelCase naming
- Updated interface definitions across all calendar-related components
- Ensured consistent data structure handling between mock and real APIs

**‚úÖ FINAL RESOLUTION CONFIRMED - CALENDAR FULLY FUNCTIONAL**:

**Phase 1: API Endpoint Updates**
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints updated from `holidays/get-holidays` to `get-holidays-mock`
- ‚úÖ All components now use consistent camelCase data structure
- ‚úÖ Fixed API parameter naming from `view=own` to `viewMode=own`

**Phase 2: Authentication Token Issues** 
- ‚úÖ Fixed localStorage token key mismatch: `auth_token` ‚Üí `accessToken`
- ‚úÖ All calendar components now use consistent authentication
- ‚úÖ JWT token authentication working across all calendar calls

**Phase 3: Calendar Layout Issues**
- ‚úÖ Added missing React Big Calendar CSS import
- ‚úÖ Calendar layout now displays correctly (no longer "spaginato")
- ‚úÖ Calendar visual styling and formatting working properly

**Phase 4: User Testing and Verification**
- ‚úÖ No more 404 errors in calendar section
- ‚úÖ No more 401 authentication errors  
- ‚úÖ Mock holiday data displays correctly in calendar interface
- ‚úÖ Calendar navigation (month/week/agenda views) functional
- ‚úÖ Employee holiday request flow functional
- ‚úÖ **USER CONFIRMED: Calendar working correctly**

**COMPREHENSIVE LESSON LEARNED**: 
1. **API Consistency**: When implementing mock APIs, ensure ALL components use identical endpoint names and parameter formats
2. **Authentication Keys**: Maintain consistent localStorage key naming across all components (`accessToken` vs `auth_token`)
3. **CSS Dependencies**: Always import required CSS files for third-party components (React Big Calendar)
4. **Testing Verification**: Never assume problems are resolved without user testing confirmation

**COMPLETE FILES UPDATED FOR CALENDAR RESOLUTION**:
- `lib/hooks/useHolidays.ts` - API endpoint, parameters, data structure
- `components/calendar/integrated-calendar.tsx` - Endpoint, parameters, token key, CSS import
- `components/calendar/mobile-calendar.tsx` - Endpoint, parameters, token key
- `components/forms/multi-step-holiday-request.tsx` - API endpoint
- `app/[locale]/(employee)/holiday-request/page.tsx` - API endpoint

**üö® CRITICAL SERVER STABILITY & AUTHENTICATION ISSUES - DEVELOPMENT PHASE 3.6**

**THE PROBLEM CASCADE**: During development session, encountered multiple cascading issues that made admin dashboard unusable:

1. **Initial Missing Dependencies**:
   - Error: `Cannot find module '@radix-ui/react-switch'` when accessing admin dashboard
   - Solution: `npm install @radix-ui/react-switch` for Switch component

2. **Frontend Compilation Failures**:
   - ESLint errors: Unescaped quotes in Italian text (', ", &apos;, &quot;)
   - TypeScript errors: Missing SystemSettings interface properties, AdminTabType mismatches
   - Solution: Fixed quote escaping and extended interfaces with all required properties

3. **JWT Token Format Incompatibility**:
   - **ROOT CAUSE**: `login-test.ts` generated tokens without required `type: 'access'` field
   - **SYMPTOM**: API calls returned "Tipo di token non valido: richiesto token di accesso" 
   - **SOLUTION**: Added `type: 'access'` to JWT payload in login-test.ts token generation
   - **CODE FIX**:
     ```typescript
     // BEFORE (broken)
     const tokenPayload = { userId, email, role };
     
     // AFTER (working)  
     const tokenPayload = { userId, email, role, type: 'access' };
     ```

4. **Database Connection Failures**:
   - **PROBLEM**: Neon database connection failing with "TypeError: fetch failed"
   - **IMPACT**: All API endpoints returning 500 errors, no data loading in admin dashboard
   - **SOLUTION**: Created mock API functions for development without database dependency

5. **Missing Authorization Headers**:
   - **PROBLEM**: `useAdminData` hook API calls missing JWT Bearer tokens
   - **SYMPTOM**: "Token mancante o formato non valido" errors  
   - **SOLUTION**: Added `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` headers to all admin API calls

6. **Incorrect Function Routing**:
   - **PROBLEM**: Hook calling nested paths (`auth/admin-approve`) that don't exist in flat structure
   - **SOLUTION**: Updated all API calls to use flat function names (`admin-approve`)

7. **Server Instability During Development**:
   - **PROBLEM**: Netlify dev server shutting down after each fix
   - **CAUSE**: Cumulative effect of multiple rapid changes and database connection issues
   - **SOLUTION**: Clean restart with mock functions, proper JWT token format

**üõ†Ô∏è COMPLETE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**

**Phase 1: Fix JWT Authentication**
- Updated `login-test.ts` to include `type: 'access'` in token payload
- Fixed all JWT token format compatibility issues with validation functions

**Phase 2: Create Mock Development APIs**  
- Created 4 mock functions with realistic test data:
  - `get-employees-mock.ts` - 3 employees including 1 pending approval
  - `get-departments-mock.ts` - 3 departments with manager assignments  
  - `get-holidays-mock.ts` - 3 holiday requests including 1 pending
  - `get-settings-mock.ts` - Complete system settings structure
- All mock functions include proper JWT authentication and role-based access

**Phase 3: Fix Frontend Integration**
- Updated `useAdminData.ts` to use mock endpoints temporarily
- Added missing Authorization headers to all API calls
- Fixed function path routing for flat Netlify structure
- Updated data structure handling for both mock and real API formats

**Phase 4: Server Stabilization**
- Clean restart with all mock functions loaded
- Verified complete authentication workflow end-to-end
- Confirmed admin dashboard loads with proper data display

**‚úÖ VALIDATION RESULTS:**
- ‚úÖ Server stable on `http://localhost:8888`
- ‚úÖ Login working: `max.giurastante@ominiaservices.net` / `admin123`
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens generated and validated correctly
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard loads without 500 errors
- ‚úÖ All mock API endpoints responding (employees, departments, holidays, settings)
- ‚úÖ Real-time statistics calculated and displayed
- ‚úÖ Professional UI with OmniaGroup branding functional

**üîß FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:**
When connecting to real database:
1. Restore original function names in `useAdminData.ts` (remove `-mock` suffix)
2. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` points to valid Neon database  
3. Verify all required environment variables loaded
4. Test authentication workflow with real user data
5. Create missing functions: `admin-approve.ts`, `approve-reject.ts`, `update-settings.ts`

**‚ö†Ô∏è LESSON LEARNED - JWT Token Compatibility:**
Always ensure JWT token generation and validation functions use identical payload structure. Mismatched token formats cause cascading authentication failures throughout the application.

**üí° DEVELOPMENT TIP - Mock APIs for Database Issues:**
When encountering database connectivity issues during frontend development, create mock API functions with realistic data to enable UI testing and development continuation without blocking progress.

**Original Phase 2.1 Issues Resolved**:
- Fixed Next.js webpack module resolution error by removing missing LanguageSwitcher component
- Successfully created all database tables with proper relationships and constraints

**‚ö†Ô∏è THE PROBLEM**: During Phase 2, we created only HTML templates for login/register test pages without connecting them to backend APIs. When testing Phase 2 backend, we discovered login form was completely non-functional - clicking login did nothing, no API calls, no authentication.

**üîß THE SOLUTION - Complete Authentication Implementation**:

**Created Authentication Infrastructure**:
- `lib/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Custom React hook for authentication state management
  ```typescript
  const { login, loading, error, user, isAuthenticated, isAdmin, logout } = useAuth();
  ```
- Updated login page with functional form handling, validation, and API integration
- Created admin dashboard with route protection and user info display
- Implemented localStorage token management and automatic redirects

**Critical Frontend-Backend Integration Points**:
1. **API URL Configuration**: 
   ```typescript
   // CRITICAL: Different URLs for development vs production
   const baseUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
     ? 'http://localhost:8888'  // Netlify dev server
     : window.location.origin;   // Production domain
   ```

2. **Error Handling**: Parse both successful responses and error states from backend
3. **Loading States**: Provide user feedback during API calls
4. **Route Protection**: Redirect unauthenticated users automatically
5. **Token Management**: Secure localStorage handling with cleanup on logout

**Issues Resolved During Implementation**:
- **Missing Register Page**: The register directory and page were not created initially when login page was created
- **404 Error**: Clicking "registrati" button resulted in 404 at `/it/register/` 
- **Non-functional Login**: Form had no onSubmit handler, no API integration, no state management
- **Backend URL Mismatch**: Frontend called localhost:3000 instead of localhost:8888 (Netlify functions)
- **No Authentication State**: No way to track user login status or persist sessions
- **No Route Protection**: Admin routes accessible without authentication

**‚úÖ LESSON FOR FUTURE SaaS PROJECTS**: 
**NEVER separate frontend and backend development completely**. Always implement:

1. **Authentication Hook First**: Create useAuth hook immediately after backend auth API
2. **Functional Forms**: Connect login/register forms to APIs during initial creation
3. **Route Protection**: Implement protected routes as soon as auth system exists  
4. **Environment-aware URLs**: Configure API endpoints for development/production from day 1
5. **Complete User Flow**: Test entire login ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí logout flow before moving to next phase

**Prevention**: When creating authentication pages in Phase 1, immediately add basic form handlers that call placeholder APIs. This prevents the disconnect between frontend templates and backend functionality.

**Dependencies**: 3.3, 4.2.1  
**Validation**: FullCalendar displays holidays correctly in all views with proper event interactions ‚úÖ

**Migration Details**:

**Root Cause of Original Issue**: React Big Calendar had persistent React error #418 and webpack module issues, with monthly view events remaining invisible despite extensive debugging and styling fixes.

**Solution Applied**: Complete migration to FullCalendar, a more robust and actively maintained calendar library.

**Key Implementation Changes**:
1. **Library Replacement**: Removed react-big-calendar and moment dependencies, added FullCalendar plugins
2. **Event Data Format**: 
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (React Big Calendar)
   { id, title, start: Date, end: Date, allDay: boolean, resource: {...} }
   
   // AFTER (FullCalendar)
   { id, title, start: string, end: string, allDay: boolean, backgroundColor, borderColor, textColor, extendedProps: { holidayEvent } }
   ```
3. **Date Handling Fix**: 
   ```typescript
   // React Big Calendar required +1 day for end dates
   const endDate = addDays(parseISO(holiday.endDate), 1)
   
   // FullCalendar uses actual end dates
   const endDate = parseISO(holiday.endDate)
   ```
4. **Custom Toolbar Refactor**: Rebuilt toolbar to use FullCalendar API methods (calendar.prev(), calendar.next(), calendar.today(), calendar.changeView())
5. **Event Handler Migration**:
   - `handleSelectSlot` ‚Üí `handleDateSelect` with FullCalendar selectInfo object
   - `handleSelectEvent` ‚Üí `handleEventClick` with FullCalendar clickInfo object
   - `handleNavigate` ‚Üí `handleDatesSet` with FullCalendar dateInfo object

   - Top row: Navigation controls (prev/next/today) + prominent month/year display
   - Bottom row: View toggles + My/Team filter + New Request button
   - Added proper gaps and padding between elements

2. **Navigation Fix Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // Added useRef to maintain FullCalendar API reference
   const calendarRef = React.useRef<any>(null)
   
   // Fixed navigation handler to use API reference
   if (calendarRef.current) {
     const calendarApi = calendarRef.current.getApi()
     calendarApi.prev() / calendarApi.next() / calendarApi.today()
   }
   ```

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Month title: Increased to `text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold` with better contrast
   - Button groups: Wrapped in rounded containers with subtle backgrounds
   - Active states: Clear color differentiation (blue for views, emerald for filters)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED FROM COUPLECOMPATIBILITY

### Next.js Deployment Architecture Decision

**LESSON**: In SaaS applications with server-side features (middleware, Netlify Functions, auth), **NEVER use `output: 'export'`** from the beginning.

**The Problem from CoupleCompatibility**:
- Started with static export (`output: 'export'`) thinking it was simpler
- Added middleware for language detection and auth routing
- Created incompatibility: middleware requires server, static export removes server
- Caused 500 errors and development/production deployment issues

**The Solution for Omnia Holiday Tracker**:
- Use **regular Next.js deployment** with server-side features from the start
- Keep middleware.ts for automatic language detection (IT/EN/ES)
- Use Netlify Functions for all backend API endpoints
- Enable proper SSR/SSG where needed

**Configuration Applied**: 
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - For SaaS with server features
const nextConfig = {
  // NO output: 'export' - use regular deployment
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: { unoptimized: false }, // Enable Next.js optimization
  serverExternalPackages: ['@neondatabase/serverless', 'bcryptjs'],
  // ... rest of config
}
```

### Translation System Architecture

**LESSON**: Duplicate object keys in translation structure cause keys to display instead of translations.

**Applied Solution**:
- Use hierarchical nested structure without duplicates
- Always use full paths in components: `t('dashboard.calendar.addHoliday')`
- Test all languages after any translation changes
- Maintain identical structure across IT/EN/ES

### React Component Best Practices

**LESSON**: Hydration mismatches and prop inconsistencies cause build errors.

**Applied Solution**:
- Consistent prop interfaces across all components
- Proper client/server component separation
- Careful state management for calendar interactions
